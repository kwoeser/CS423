# PersonalWebsite

**Description:** A personal website built with React.

**Primary Language:** JavaScript

**Topics:** (Add relevant topics here, e.g., portfolio, personal website, React, JavaScript, web development)

## Overview

This repository contains the code for my personal website. It's built using React and leverages a variety of libraries for features such as dynamic content loading, email integration, animations, and more.  This website serves as a portfolio, blog, and general online presence.

## Installation

To get the project up and running locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd PersonalWebsite
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install or pnpm install
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev  # or yarn dev or pnpm dev
    ```

    This will start the Vite development server, typically on `http://localhost:3000`.  The website will automatically reload as you make changes to the code.

2.  **Build for production:**

    ```bash
    npm run build  # or yarn build or pnpm build
    ```

    This command will create a production-ready build of the website in the `dist` directory.

3.  **Preview the production build:**

    ```bash
    npm run preview # or yarn preview or pnpm preview
    ```

    This will serve the production build locally for testing purposes.
