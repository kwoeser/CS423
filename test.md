## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/PersonalWebsite.git
    cd PersonalWebsite
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will launch the website in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:5173/`.

2.  **Build for production:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This will create an optimized build of the website in the `dist` directory.  You can then deploy the contents of this directory to a static hosting provider like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

## Configuration

Several configuration options are available, allowing you to customize the website to your specific needs:

*   **`package.json`:**  Contains dependencies managed by npm. Includes development and production dependencies.  Check that dependencies are correctly installed.
*   **Environment Variables:**  Consider using environment variables (e.g., `.env` file with `vite`) for sensitive information like API keys for contact form submission.  These variables can be accessed within the application using `import.meta.env`.

*   `react`: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
